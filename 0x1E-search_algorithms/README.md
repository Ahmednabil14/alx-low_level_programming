# Search Algorithms Project

This repository contains the implementation of various search algorithms in C, as part of the SE Foundations curriculum. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of different search algorithms, their time and space complexities, and their applications.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Search**: Searches for a value in an array by checking each element sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: Searches for a value in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Jump Search**: Searches for a value in a sorted array by jumping ahead by fixed steps or skipping some elements instead of searching all elements.
- **Interpolation Search**: Searches for a value in a sorted array by estimating the position of the value to be searched.
- **Exponential Search**: Searches for a value in a sorted array by first finding the range where the value is present and then performing a binary search.
- **Advanced Binary Search**: A variant of binary search that returns the index of the first occurrence of a value in a sorted array.
- **Jump Search in a Singly Linked List**: Applies the jump search algorithm to a singly linked list.
- **Linear Search in a Skip List**: Applies the linear search algorithm to a skip list.
